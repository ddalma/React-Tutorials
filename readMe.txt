My journey in understanding how React works. The best way to learn any language, in my opinion, is by working with it in several projects.


React is a javascript Library  for building user interfaces and single page application quickly.
The V in MVC. Just the UI.
Uses a virtual DOM. Simpler programming model and better performance. 
Can render on the server using Node
Implements a one-way reactive data flow.
Very simple and beautiful
Scalable
